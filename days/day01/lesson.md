# Day 1: JavaScript Introduction, Setup & Syntax

## Objectives
- Understand what JavaScript is and where it runs
- Learn how to set up and run JS in the browser
- Write your first JS code

## What is JavaScript?
JavaScript is a versatile, high-level programming language used to make web pages interactive. It runs in all modern browsers and is essential for web development.

## How JavaScript Runs
- Runs in the browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)
- Can also run on servers (Node.js)
- Used for interactivity, animations, data handling, and more

## Setting Up
1. Open any `.html` file in your browser.
2. Add a `<script>` tag inside the HTML to write JavaScript.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>JS Demo</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Hello JavaScript!</h1>
  <script>
    // Your JS code here
    alert('Welcome to JavaScript!');
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

## Basic Syntax
- Statements end with `;` (semicolon, optional but recommended)
- Comments: `// single line`, `/* multi-line */`
- Case-sensitive language

## Example
```js
console.log('Hello, world!');
```

## Pro Tip
Use your browser’s DevTools (F12 or right-click → Inspect → Console) to run and test JavaScript code live.

**Next:** Practice writing your first JavaScript code in the exercise!
